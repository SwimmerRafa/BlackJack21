At 17 points or higher \n                  the dealer must stay. \n                  You are betting that you have a better hand than the dealer. The better hand is the hand where the sum of the card values is closer to 21 without \n                  exceeding 21. The detailed outcome of the hand follows:\n                </p>\n                <ul>\n                  <li>If the player is dealt an Ace and a ten-value card (called a \"blackjack\" or \"natural\"), and the dealer does not, the player wins and usually receives a bonus.</li>\n                  <li>If the player exceeds a sum of 21 (\"busts\"); the player loses, even if the dealer also exceeds 21.</li>\n                  <li>If the dealer exceeds 21 (\"busts\") and the player does not; the player wins.</li>\n                  <li>If the player attains a final sum higher than the dealer and does not bust; the player wins.</li>\n                  <li>If both dealer and player receive a blackjack or any other hands with the same sum, called a \"push\", no one wins.</li>\n                </ul>\n              </div>\n              \n              <div className=\"w3-container\">\n                <h3><strong>Player Decisions</strong></h3>\n                <ul>\n                  <li><strong>Hit :</strong> Take another card from the dealer.</li>\n                  <li><strong>Stand :</strong> Take no more cards, also known as \"stand pat\", \"stick\", or \"stay\"..</li>\n                </ul>\n              </div>\n              \n              <div className=\"w3-container\">\n                <h3><strong>Cards</strong></h3>\n                <img src={baraja} className=\"w3-round w3-margin-left w3-image w3-center\" alt=\"Norway\"/>\n              </div>\n          \n            \n            <div className =\"w3-container footer w3-grey\">\n              <p>\n                <strong>Developed </strong> by \n                <a style={{color: \"paleturquoise\"}} href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/rafael-moreno-ca%C3%B1as-aba58a1a6/\"> Rafael Moreno</a>,\n                <a style={{color: \"paleturquoise\"}} href=\"#\"> Ricardo Velazquez </a> and\n                <a style={{color: \"paleturquoise\"}} href=\"#\"> Eric Gomez</a>\n              </p>\n            </div>\n          \n          </div>\n    )\n}\n\nexport default Main\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
